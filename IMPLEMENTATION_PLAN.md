## ✅ Key Technical Decisions CONFIRMED

### 1. Embedding Model Choice
**SELECTED:** `all-mpnet-base-v2` (better accuracy, user prefers accuracy over speed)

### 2. Real-time Communication
**SELECTED:** WebSocket connection (speed is crucial per user requirement)

### 3. Message Processing Pipeline
**SELECTED:** Simple synchronous processing (user wants simplicity)

### 4. Data Storage Strategy
**CONFIRMED:** SQLite + ChromaDB approach (working well in tests)

### 5. Deployment Strategy
**SELECTED:** Docker Compose (user confirmed this is fine for now)

### 6. Logic Control Architecture
**CRITICAL:** Heavy use of n8n workflows for business logic orchestration

---

## 🔄 n8n Workflow Architecture (CORE SYSTEM)

The application logic will be primarily controlled by n8n workflows, with the backend serving as a lightweight API layer. This approach leverages n8n's powerful automation capabilities and AI integrations.

### Primary n8n Workflows (Simplified 2-Workflow Architecture)

#### 1. **Historical Data Migration** (`data-migration.json`)
```
Daily Cron → Read SQLite Messages → Anonymize Data → Generate Embeddings → Store in ChromaDB → Log Progress
```
**Purpose:** One-time setup + maintenance processing of historical WhatsApp messages
**Nodes:**
- `nodes-base.cron` - Daily scheduled execution
- `nodes-base.code` - Read unprocessed messages from SQLite
- `nodes-base.set` - Anonymize personal data using regex patterns
- `nodes-langchain.embeddingsHuggingFaceInference` - Generate embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- `nodes-base.code` - Store embeddings in ChromaDB + mark as processed

#### 2. **Real-time Operations Hub** (`real-time-operations.json`)
```
Multiple Triggers → Route by Operation Type → Process → Broadcast Results
```
**Purpose:** All real-time operations in a single workflow with intelligent routing
**Triggers:**
- WhatsApp Message Webhook → Message processing + similarity search + suggestions
- Health Monitor Cron (5min) → System health checks + status broadcast
- WebSocket Event Webhook → Event routing + client broadcast

**Key Flow:**
```
Webhook/Cron Input → Set Operation Type → Merge → Switch Router → Process → Broadcast
```

**Routing Logic:**
- `whatsapp_message` → Store message → Generate embedding → ChromaDB search → Broadcast suggestions
- `health_monitor` → Check all systems → Broadcast health status
- `websocket_event` → Process event → Broadcast to appropriate clients

### n8n Integration Benefits
- **Visual Logic**: Business logic visible as flow diagrams
- **AI Integration**: Native LangChain nodes for embeddings and AI processing
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic and error branches
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new workflows and modify existing ones
- **Monitoring**: Native execution tracking and debugging
- **Code Reuse**: Shared functions across workflows via Code nodes

### Backend API Role (Simplified)
The Node.js backend becomes a lightweight layer focused on:
- WebSocket connection management
- Basic CRUD operations
- Health check endpoints
- Static file serving for React frontend
